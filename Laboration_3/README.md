# Laboration 3

## Environment & Tools

## Purpose
The purpose of this class is to practice on the concepts of encapsulation and the use of overload constructors to 
ease the maniputation of data members that are class objectsencapsulation and the use of overload operaator makes it 
possible to hide actual inplementation of different operations from the user. The use of another class called the 
userInterface, which acts as an intermediary between user and PersonList class makes the program look simpler and 
easier to follow through than it actually is.

## Procedures
This Lab was carried out by creating Name, Address, Person, PersonList and UserInterface as specified in the 
instructions for Lab 2

## Discussion
The Lab was a good to exercise to acheive the above purposes as well as prcticing on design and implementation of functions.
As the program got bigger it became more and more difficult to keep track of the different functions and how and 
where to call them. I ran into problems on how to access my vector inside PersonList in Userinterface class. I was 
tempted to use getter and setter but read online that this was not recommended when dealing with vectors. So i finally 
went around it by writing member funtions in PersonList and calling the functions in userInterface which wworked perfect.
Overall, the lab took longer than a week for me but I learned alot through this lab.I think the lecture note gave enough to go from with a small margin for personal 
research.
