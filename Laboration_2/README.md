# Laboration 2

## Environment & Tools
Operating system: windows,
IDE: CLion 2019.3.3
compiler: Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler
CMake version: 3.15.6
Git version: 2.25.0.windows.1

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to learn the basics of object- oriented programming through the use of Class, object, 
encapsulation, the use of a class in another class and to write a program that uses class.

## Procedures
(see intructions for lab 2)

Create a class, with Class name - Name, that handles a preson's first name and last names and the classes member functions.
 
Create a class Address that handles persons address with member data; street name, post number and city and it's member functions.
 
Create a class Person with data member name (Name), address (Address), social security number(string) and shoesize.  (int)
and the class member functions.

Create a vector that loads persons of class Person to a position in the vector.
Create a function that prompts for a person's information, read the information about a person into an Person object and returns the person within the Class Person

Create a function that calls the function that load person and adds it to the vector.

Create a function that print all persons from the vector.

Write a main program that initially load 3 persons to the vector and then reads information about a person and add the person to the vector, then prints all persons in the vector. 

## Discussion
The purpose of the lab was fulfilled and the lab was a good exercise to achieve the purpose of the lab. The examples were of great help and did prepare me for doing the Lab. I however would have loved to have a better example for the use of a class in a class and also the use of vectors but I did get these from the course literature so it was quite ok. overall I did enjoy doing the lab abd leart alot.
