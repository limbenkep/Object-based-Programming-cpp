# Laboration 2

## Environment & Tools
Operating system: windows,
IDE: CLion 2019.3.3
compiler: Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler
CMake version: 3.15.6
Git version: 2.25.0.windows.1

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to learn the basics of object- oriented programming through the use of Class, object, 
encapsulation, the use of a class in another class and to write a program that uses class.
The use of classes makes it possible to hide data which can only be assessed from outsude the class by calling a member
 function. This method of programming that uses classes (OOP) is advantageous in that it is more maintainable
 , the codes can be easily reusable for example if I need the classes Address or erson for another lab, I just need 
 to copy from this lab and modify if necessary and use. This project also uses 
 Vectors provide an optimal way to store the objects that can be easily accessed for example 
 by a print function. The use of classes and functions makes the main program code less crowded with just a feww lines 
 of codes calling functions whose implementations are hidden in the defeination or class .cpp files,
  making it easier to get an overview of the program by looking a the main.
 
 

## Procedures
(see intructions for lab 2)

Create a class, with Class name - Name, that handles a preson's first name and last names and the classes member functions.
 
Create a class Address that handles persons address with member data; street name, post number and city and it's member functions.
 
Create a class Person with data member name (Name), address (Address), social security number(string) and shoesize.  (int)
and the class member functions.

Create a vector that loads persons of class Person to a position in the vector.
Create a function that prompts for a person's information, read the information about a person into an Person object and returns the person within the Class Person

Create a function that calls the function that load person and adds it to the vector.

Create a function that print all persons from the vector.

Write a main program that initially load 3 persons to the vector and then reads information about a person and add the person to the vector, then prints all persons in the vector. 

## Discussion
The purpose of the lab was fulfilled and the lab was a good exercise to achieve the purpose of the lab. The examples were of great help and did prepare me for doing the Lab. I however would have loved to have a better example for the use of a class in a class and also the use of vectors but I did get these from the course literature so it was quite ok. overall I did enjoy doing the lab abd leart alot.
