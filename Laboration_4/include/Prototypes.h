 * Lab 4 program compares the complexity of quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort and bubble sor algorithms by
 * comparing the mean sorting time for different sizes of arrays
 * This program contains 3 classes
 * - IntArray class that generates the arrays
 * - Sort class that executes the sorting
 * - program request sorting for different sizes of arrays and records statistics in a file and prints on the screen
 * The statistics containing algorithm's name, size of array and average sorting time is exported to excel
 * and plotted to compare different sorting methods
