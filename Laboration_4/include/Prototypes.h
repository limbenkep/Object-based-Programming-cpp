/*
 * Lab 4 program compares the complexity of quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort and bubble sor algorithms by
 * comparing the mean sorting time for different sizes of arrays
 * This program contains 2 classes
 * - IntArray class that generates an array of a given size and sorts
 * - Program class made of one function run that calls for sorting arrays of sizes 5 000, 10 000, 15 000, 20 000,
 * 25 000,30 000, 35 000 och 40 000 element.
 * each sort is done 10 times for the same size and the name of the sort, size and average sorting time is record
 * and stored in a file and these statistics are also printed on the screen as the sorting is executed.
 * The statistics containing algorithm's name, size of array and average sorting time is exported to excel
 * and plotted to compare different sorting methods with the Big *0* theoretical values
