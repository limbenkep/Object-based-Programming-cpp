# Laboration 5

## Environment & Tools
windows Operating system, CLion 2019.3.3 IDE, Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler, CMake version: 3.15.6, Git version: 2.25.0.windows.1
## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to learn to use dynamically linked lists, abstract data types like queue and iterators.
## Procedures
The aims of this lab was achieved by writing a program that handles a housing queue system and allows user to 
Add a person to queue, Offer a person housing, Print housing queue list, Print data on a person in the queue,
Remove a person from the queue and  Save queue to file by choosing options from a menu.
## Discussion
In this lab, I have created a queue list that store all persons on the queue in the order they are added, assign housing 
to the oldest person in the queue and adds new persons at the end of the queue. I use the iterator to iterate through
the queue to print list or to search for a person in the list. With the use of the growth overload constructors, 
I can use the iterator ++ eventhough I am working with nodes. To get the data on a person I use the dereference operator
(&operator* ) which returns the Person object stored in the given node. I have learned more about working with nodes and 
how the nodes are linked to each other in a list. It has been a great learning experience going back to lab 3 to reuse the code. Looking through 
my Person, Name and Address classes, I have identified some errors I made and  improved my codes after learning a bit more on object oriented 
programming and it is easier to remember not to make the same mistakes in the future than if I had just read about it.
The lab description provide detailed guide which made it easy to do the lab and the course material was enough help. I believe have achieved the goals of this lab. 

Thank you for all the great feedbacks. I enjoyed this course very much.
