# Laboration 1

## Environment & Tools
- Operating system: windows, 
- IDE:  CLion 2019.3.3
- compiler: Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler
- CMake version: 3.15.6
- Git version:  2.25.0.windows.1

## Purpose
- learn how to use pointers and arrays
## Procedures
To reproduce these reults, Clone repositories from git@bitbucket.org:miun_dt018g/holi1900_solutions_vt20.git. 
Open laboration_1 on CLion, open main and run. 
I got errors messages initailly which was solved by updating me CMakeLists.txt information on project name,
CMake minimum version. I also had some errors with syntax errors and pointers that was easily corrected on second glance.
## Discussion
The purpose of the lab was fullfilled. I learned how to generate random numbers, 
how to fill an array, how to work with pointers and dynamic arrays. It was very difficult to learn the use of 
CMake, CLion, git and do Lab a within one week since I did an equivalent introduction course which did not use these. 
I think it will be useful to have better examples related to the labs in the lectures. I think the lecture were not sufficient
